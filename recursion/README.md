### Recursion

Recursion project given by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion), consisting of two projects:
* Fibonacci Sequence
* Merge Sort

#### Fibonacci Sequence

This code represents exercises to use iteration and recursion to produce the fibonacci sequence up to a user specificed amount. The function use is simple and outputs an array.

```
irb(main):1:0> fibs(10)
=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

irb(main):2:0> fibs_rec(15)
=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377]
```

#### Merge Sort

Merge is sort algorithm running on O(nlogn) time. It's a recursive sort that uses a divide and conquer approach to sorting large lists.

```
irb(main):1:0> a = [1, 3, 2, 10, -9, 12, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1223, 44, 9, 12, 8]
irb(main):2:0> merge_sort(a)
=> [-9, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 44, 1223]
```
