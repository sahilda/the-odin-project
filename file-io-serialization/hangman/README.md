### Hangman

This is a single-player ruby version of the popular game, Hangman. What is cool though, is the ability for one to save and load games in the middle. Please take a look and let me know any comments you've got! To play the game,
please clone this directory, and run the command:
```
> ruby hangman.rb
```

Here's some sample output:
```
Welcome to Hangman. Are you up for the challenge?

Do you want to (l)oad a saved game, (s)tart a new game, (d)elete a saved game, or (q)uit?

Misses: None. Your Guess? (enter 'save' at anytime to save your game).
s

Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
