### Hangman

This is a single-player ruby version of the popular game, Hangman. What is cool though, is the ability for one to save and load games in the middle. Please take a look and let me know any comments you've got! To play the game,
please clone this directory, and run the command:
```
ruby hangman.rb
```

This is based on [The Oden Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/file-i-o-and-serialization).
